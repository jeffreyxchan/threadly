# threadly

Demo the static version here: [threadly-static](http://jeffreyxchan.me/threadly/)

## Description
This branch contains the static version of threadly that was built
through a tutorial released by Codecademy. It contains the most
basic front end features of the threadly app. The comments on the
thread just don't persist due to lack of back end and database.
