## Description
It's a simple webpage that allows a user to type in any random thoughts and comments into the input field. After they press the
"post" button or hit <Enter> on their keyboard, the input string will be attached to the thread of comments on the page.
It's goal is to simulate the effect of writing thoughts down on scratch paper or a notepad.

This page just makes use of standard <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery</b>. It was great to take a break from all the frustration and pain that came from learning D3.js and React.js to just code a simple and cool little project like this. Despite it's simplicity, I am very happy to welcome this project as one of my repositories because it is officially the first website based repository I have added to this account. Therefore, it's pretty special.

This page was made in response to a video tutorial Codecademy released in 2016.
