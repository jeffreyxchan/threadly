## Description
threadly is simple interactive webpage that allows a user to type in any random thoughts and comments into the input field. After they press the "post" button or hit <Enter> on their keyboard, the input string will be appended at the top of the  thread of comments below the input field. It simulates the effect of writing thoughts down on scratch paper or a notepad.

This page just makes use of standard <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery</b>. It was refreshing to take a break from all the frustration and pain that came from learning D3.js and React.js and just code a cool little project like this. Despite it's simplicity, It's officially the first web development-based repository in my collection.

This project was made in response to a video tutorial that Codecademy released in 2016.
